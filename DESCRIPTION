Description: There are some things that I wish were easier with the stringr 
    or stringi packages. The foremost of these is the extraction of numbers from 
    strings. stringr makes you figure out the regex for yourself, strex 
    takes care of this for you. There are many more useful functionalities in
    strex. In particular, there's a `match_arg()` function which is more 
    flexible than the base `match.arg()`. Contributions to this package are 
    encouraged: it is intended as a miscellany of string manipulation functions
    which cannot be found in stringi or stringr.
